# Network Security Labs

Educational network security proof-of-concepts for learning how common network-level attacks and detections work in controlled lab environments.

This repository focuses on *understanding* network threats by implementing them in a minimal, transparent way.

## What’s included
- ARP spoofing and ARP spoof detection
- DNS spoofing
- Packet sniffing
- Network scanning
- MAC address manipulation
- File interception and simple code injection PoCs

## Purpose & scope
These tools are intended for:
- learning network security fundamentals
- lab environments
- defensive awareness (understanding attacker techniques)

They are **not** designed for real-world misuse or unauthorized environments.

## Tech
- Python
- Scapy
- Linux networking primitives

## Notes
The implementations are intentionally simple and readable to make the underlying concepts easy to follow.

## Disclaimer
Use only in environments you own or are explicitly authorized to test.
